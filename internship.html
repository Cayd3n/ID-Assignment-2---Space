    <p class="intern-text d-flex justify-content-center ani">We strategically hire our Pathways Interns based on long-term potential and alignment with NASA’s future workforce needs. 
        We’re looking for students who are captivated with our Vision, Mission, and 
        Core Values and embody characteristics integral to NASA’s success. Top candidates are well-rounded students from diverse backgrounds 
        who demonstrate curiosity, team-orientation, excellence, a passion for exploration, agility, and resilience. Prior experience is not
         required. If you have a passion for our mission and feel the calling to change the history of humanity, the Pathways Internship Program

            As a Pathways Intern, we invest in you on purpose — assigning you with challenging, meaningful work aligned with your academic or career 
            interests, providing you with life-long learning and growth opportunities, and cultivating a supportive community that offers you a home away from home. 
          </div><br>
          <div class="col-sm intern-text ani">
            Throughout your Pathways Internship, you’re given the autonomy to define your own career trajectory at NASA. At the beginning of your
             internship, we will work with you to develop an “Individual Development Plan” that will help put your experience and path in your 
             hands by defining assignments, 
            training events, and learning opportunities that will help you achieve your career goals. <br>

            As you get closer to graduation, we will evaluate your experience and consider you for full-time employment that would begin after you complete your degree. No additional job applications needed!
